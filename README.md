# Predicting Boston Marathon Finishing Times

## Metis Project Luther - Regression

### Project Overview

Road running, as of 2015, is a $1.4 billion industry.  Many people run for various reasons such as physical/mental health improvements and many runners enjoy the challenge of completing a race in some goal time they have set for themselves.  In particular, elite runners make a livelihood from performing well at big races such as the Boston Marathon.

There are many factors that go into the final result of a marathon such as training rigor and nutrition, but if we held these things constant, as a serious athlete would, could a race time be predicted based on prior year results?



### Problem Statement

Why would you want to predict a race time? Well, large companies such as Nike and Adidas spend a lot of money in sponsorship of athletes.  An algorithm that could predict a race time of a runner could aide one of these companies in selecting the ideal athelte that would maximize exposure of their product since the larger races are aired live and tend to focus camera time on the top runners of the race.

Often the finishers finish within seconds of each other, so predicting race times with such precision will be a challenge.  I decided to attack this problem using 4 years (2015-2018) of Boston Marathon finishing times.   The data is narrowed down to "legacy runners" (repeat runners) fed into various models using linear regression and stochastic gradient descent.  Metrics of $R^2$ and $RMSE$ (Root Mean Squared Error) are used to measure the results.
